      <description>Course overview One of the central themes in both the theory and application of probability is understanding asymptotics of a sequence of random objects $\{X_n:n\geq 1\}$ as $n\to\infty$. In undergraduate probability as well as a first graduate level course in probability, much of the emphasis is on real valued random variables. As we progresses towards the forefront of research, we come across much more complicated objects including:
 Random objects in function space representing empirical processes derived from a sequence of observations or lengths of queues.</description>
