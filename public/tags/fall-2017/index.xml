 Course overview One of the central themes in both the theory and application of probability is understanding asymptotics of a sequence of random objects $\{X_n:n\geq 1\}$ as $n\to\infty$. In undergraduate probability as well as a first graduate level course in probability, much of the emphasis is on real valued random variables.</description>
